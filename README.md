# Health_Insurance_premium

Health Insurance is a type of insurance that covers medical expenses. A person who has taken a health insurance policy gets health insurance cover by paying a 
particular premium amount. There are a lot of factors that determine the premium of health insurance. 

The amount of the premium for a health insurance policy depends from person to person, as many factors affect the amount of the premium for a health insurance policy.
Letâ€™s say age, a young person is very less likely to have major health problems compared to an older person. Thus, treating an older person will be expensive 
compared to a young one. That is why an older person is required to pay a high premium compared to a young person.

Just like age, many other factors affect the premium for a health insurance policy. Hope you now have understood what health insurance is and how the premium 
for a health insurance policy is determined. In the section below, I will take you through the task of health insurance premium prediction with machine learning 
using Python.

The dataset that I am using for the task of health insurance premium prediction is collected from Kaggle. It contains data about:

the age of the person
gender of the person
Body Mass Index of the person
how many children the person is having
whether the person smokes or not
the region where the person lives
and the charges of the insurance premium
